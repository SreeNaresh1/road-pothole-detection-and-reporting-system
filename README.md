# Road Pothole Detection and Reporting System

The **Road Pothole Detection and Reporting System** is an innovative solution designed to enhance road safety and streamline maintenance by detecting potholes in real time and integrating the findings into navigation platforms.

## Features

- **Real-Time Pothole Detection**: Uses advanced machine learning and image processing techniques.
- **Navigation Integration**: Suggests alternate routes to avoid pothole-affected areas.
- **Data Analytics**: Provides insights for road maintenance and management.
- **Cloud Integration**: Leverages AWS services for scalability and reliability.



## Tech Stack

**Client:**  
- React (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

**Server:**  
- Java 17 or higher  
- Python 3.9+ (Flask for machine learning and backend integration)

**Database:**  
- MySQL (for data storage and management)

**Cloud Services:**  
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk (for backend deployment)  
- AWS RDS (Managed database service for MySQL)  
- AWS Amplify (for hosting the frontend)

**Machine Learning:**  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** Used for image classification and feature extraction.  
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** Real-time object detection algorithm used for detecting objects in images and videos.  
- **Flask:** A lightweight Python web framework used for deploying machine learning models.

**Version Control:**  
- Git, GitHub

**Other Tools:**  
- Postman (for API testing)  
- Vite (for bundling)  
- ESLint (for linting)
